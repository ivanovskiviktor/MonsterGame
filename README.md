# Monster Game made with Vue.js
 Initially, both the player and the monster have 100% health. 
 Player can use attack, heal and use special attack on every third round and monster attacks back the player every time he attacks or use heal/special attack.
 Player can surrender, too. 
 There is a battle log that reports who attacked, what type of attack was used and how much health was taken.
